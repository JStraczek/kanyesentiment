# kanyesentiment
Simple python script that gives you Kanye West quotes and tells you how positive or negative their sentiment is.

Instruction:

1. Clone the repo: I would suggest just downloading the zip as this repo contains only one file. 
2. Run the python script: Having python installed, navigate to the folder with the script using the console and run this command on windows: 'python kanyesentiment.py', alternatively on Linux: 'python3 kanyesentiment.py'
3. The script will ask for user input at the start.
4. Enjoy!
